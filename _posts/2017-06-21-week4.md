- [Added model class, implemented simple put method.](https://github.com/antego/series-rest-api-cache/commit/bd57df76f5e598f737b544cf462c156ffdc5f2d9)
- Had a problem with org.infinispan.query.Search class. It is absent in a classpath. And the docs has nothing to say about that. This class is entry point in all examples. Must try different query mechanism, such as [Ickle](http://infinispan.org/docs/stable/user_guide/user_guide.html#query.ickle).
